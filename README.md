# PRODIGY_GA_04

This project implements the Pix2Pix model, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), for image-to-image translation. The model learns to convert input images into output images (e.g., sketches to realistic images, black-and-white to color).

FEATURES:-
1. Generator: U-Net architecture.

2. Discriminator: PatchGAN architecture.

3. Training: Trains using paired images (e.g., input and target) with adversarial and L1 loss.

4. Checkpointing: Saves model checkpoints every 10 epochs.

RESULT:-
After training, the model generates images from input data based on learned patterns.
